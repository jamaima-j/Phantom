Digital Shepp-Logan Phantom Generation for Virtual MRI Simulation

Introduction:
The Shepp-Logan phantom is a widely used digital phantom to verify reconstruction methods in
computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Numerous ellipses in this
phantom represent the human skull's internal parts. This report presents the implementation of an
adjusted generation of the Shepp-Logan phantom in MATLAB. Three phantom versions are
generated: an overlappingless structures version, a variant with round shapes added outside the
head, and a concentric circles version.
